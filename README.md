# Visual Representation of Data Structures

A data structure is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory. An example of several common
data structures are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, graphs etc. Algorithms are used
to manipulate the data contained in these data structures such as searching and sorting. Algorithms
and data structures are important areas of computer science. In spite of the fact, the most common
algorithms and data structures have already been implemented in many programming languages
and they are also available in many libraries, every programmer and student of computer science
should know their principles. Algorithm visualizations can be an effective way to explain these
principles. These Visualizations of the execution of the data structures which can promote better
understanding of the data structures and its underlying algorithms. The aim of this project is to
visualize some data structures which gives us the outside view of data structures. In this project,
the data structures are visualized by using the Java language where Object Oriented concepts are
considered to perform all algorithms and for Graphical User Interface Java Swing is used.
